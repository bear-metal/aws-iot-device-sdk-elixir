  @moduledoc ~S"""
  GenEvent executes handlers sequentially in a single loop of the GenEvent.manager process.
  To avoid this bottleneck, we ensure that handlers do nothing other than forwarding events (i.e. delegation).
  Also, please use `GenEvent.add_mon_handler/3` if available, so that the calling process that adds the handler would receive the message `{:gen_event_EXIT, handler, reason}` if the event handler is later deleted.

  ## Usage
    iex> {:ok, event_manager} = GenEvent.start_link([])
    iex> GenEvent.add_mon_handler(event_manager, EventHandler, [broadcast: {MyApp.PubSub, "thing_shadow_event"}])

  @doc """
  Provideds an external API to make it easy to do garbage collection on `manager`.

  Only required to be called once for each GenEvent.manager, as the GenEvent.manager will perform garbage-collection for all registered handlers, before processing the next message.
